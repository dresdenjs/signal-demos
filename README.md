# Signal-Demos
This monorepo, managed by [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), contains some examples about signals.

* [demos/simple-signal-raw-demo](demos/simple-signal-raw-demo) - Has a very basic signal implementation and show-cases raw usage including a PoC how one could optimize signal usage with _tagged template literals_.
* [demos/simple-signal-angular-demo](demos/simple-signal-angular-demo) - Demos how to use signals in Angular applications and how one could easily implement a custom signal, that would work the same as Angular's built-in signal _primitive_.
